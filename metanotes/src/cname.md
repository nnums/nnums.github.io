# CNAME

Github pages, which I'm using as I start this thing up, requires that you have a CNAME file.

If your site is defined in the root directory (`/`), the CNAME file should be in the root directory.
If your site is defined in the docs directory (`/docs`), the CNAME file should be in the docs directory.

In my case, I'm displaying the rendered site at `https://nnums.com` so the CNAME contents are set to

```txt
nnums.com
```

.
