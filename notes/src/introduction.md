# Introduction

I'm learning as I go how to make this website, and I figured I might as well make my notes on how to do it public.

Maybe they'll help someone, and certainly having a searchable book of notes that is always available will help me.

So think of this mini-book as a metabook -- not so much the content of the www.nnums.com site as a whole, but notes on how to make the site work.
