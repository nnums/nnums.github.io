# Pages Rendering Notes

As I experiment with pages, I'll take down notes to present the experimental results.

## It takes time (about 1 or 2 minutes?) for a change to propagate to the website

When I add or change content in the docs file and push that change to github, I typically need to wait a couple of minutes before I can see the results of that change.

## index.html == `/`

I get the same result from each of the following urls:

- `https://www.nnums.com`
- `https://www.nnums.com/`
- `https://www.nnums.com/index`
- `https://www.nnums.com/index.html`

Note that I don't get redirects, just identical content.
