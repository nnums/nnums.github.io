# Approach

This repository is built around 2 goals:

1. Create a useful artifact for the web, meaning readable fast html.
2. Create readable source content in text format that will be nice for humans to read decades from now.

So most of the information here will have at least two forms.

One form will be rendered html in the docs folder.
This can look ugly when you read the source code but should be performant and pretty when you read the website.

The other form will be in the root under various non-docs subdirectories.
It should have legible, maintainable source code.
So that will mean markdown or jupyter notebooks depending on what is convenient at the time.

The flow should typically be from source to rendered, and the rendering will be mostly automatic using various tools.
