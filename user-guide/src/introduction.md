# Introduction

Nnums is about effectively handling data that streams from your app.

Currently, we develop two products that, under the hood use the same technology: Haven and NightWatch.

## Haven

Haven is a way to stream app data to object storage.
It's meant to be the cheapest way to reliably store small bits of data.

While Nightwatch is optimized around data *about* your app (is it working, how is performance, etc), Haven is optimized to store the data that *is* your app -- things that your users want to keep and retrieve.

## NightWatch

NightWatch is a log analytics service.
